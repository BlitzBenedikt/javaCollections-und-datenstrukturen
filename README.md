# Exception Handling Lesson

## Overview
This project is designed to teach students about exception handling in programming. It includes a main HTML page that provides explanations, tasks, and solutions related to exception handling concepts. The lesson is structured to engage students for approximately 90 minutes, with tasks that progressively increase in difficulty.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

- **index.html**: The main HTML page that explains exception handling and includes tasks for students.
- **css/**: Contains stylesheets for the project.
  - **styles.css**: Custom styles for the HTML page.
  - **normalize.css**: A CSS reset for consistent styling across browsers.
- **js/**: Contains JavaScript files for functionality.
  - **main.js**: Handles user interactions and manages the visibility of solutions.
  - **solutions.js**: Contains the solutions to the tasks provided.
- **examples/**: Contains example code demonstrating various levels of exception handling.
  - **basic-exceptions.js**: Basic exception handling concepts.
  - **intermediate-exceptions.js**: Intermediate exception handling concepts.
  - **advanced-exceptions.js**: Advanced exception handling concepts.
- **assets/**: Contains project assets.
  - **favicon.svg**: The favicon for the project.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Follow the instructions provided on the page to complete the tasks.
3. Use the "View Solutions" button to check your answers after attempting the tasks.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Understand the concept of exception handling and its importance in programming.
- Apply basic, intermediate, and advanced exception handling techniques in their code.
- Develop problem-solving skills by completing progressively challenging tasks.

## Engagement
The tasks are designed to take approximately 90 minutes to complete, allowing students to explore exception handling in a hands-on manner. Each task builds on the previous one, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the topic.
